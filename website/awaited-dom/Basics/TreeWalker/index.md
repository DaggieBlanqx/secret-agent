# TreeWalker

<div class='overview'>The <strong><code>TreeWalker</code></strong> object represents the nodes of a document subtree and a position within them.</div>

<div class='overview'>A <code>TreeWalker</code> can be created using the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/createTreeWalker" title="The Document.createTreeWalker() creator method returns a newly created TreeWalker object."><code>Document.createTreeWalker()</code></a> method.</div>
