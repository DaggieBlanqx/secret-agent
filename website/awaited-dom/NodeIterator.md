# NodeIterator

<div class='overview'><span class="seoSummary">The <strong><code>NodeIterator</code></strong> interface represents an iterator over the members of a list of the nodes in a subtree of the DOM. The nodes will be returned in document order.</span></div>

## Properties

### .filter <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#filter}

Returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeFilter" title="A NodeFilter interface represents an object used to filter the nodes in a NodeIterator or TreeWalker. They don't know anything about the DOM or how to traverse nodes; they just know how to evaluate a single node against the provided filter."><code>NodeFilter</code></a> used to select the relevant nodes.

#### **Type**: `null`

### .pointerBeforeReferenceNode <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#pointerBeforeReferenceNode}

Returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Boolean" title="REDIRECT Boolean [en-US]"><code>Boolean</code></a> flag that indicates whether the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/NodeIterator" title="The NodeIterator interface represents an iterator over the members of a list of the nodes in a subtree of the DOM. The nodes will be returned in document order."><code>NodeIterator</code></a> is anchored before, the flag being <code>true</code>, or after, the flag being <code>false</code>, the anchor node.

#### **Type**: `null`

### .referenceNode <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#referenceNode}

Returns the <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a> to which the iterator is anchored.

#### **Type**: `null`

### .root <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#root}

Returns a <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a> representing the root node as specified when the <code>NodeIterator</code> was created.

#### **Type**: `null`

### .whatToShow <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#whatToShow}


	<p>Returns an <code>unsigned long</code> being a bitmask made of constants describing the types of <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a> that must to be presented.

## Methods

### .detach*(...args)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#detach}

This operation is a no-op. It doesn't do anything. Previously it was telling the engine that the <code>NodeIterator</code> was no more used, but this is now useless.

#### **Arguments**:


 - none

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### .nextNode*(...args)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#nextNode}

Returns the next <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a> in the document, or <code>null</code> if there are none.

#### **Arguments**:


 - none

#### **Returns**: `Promise<void>`

### .previousNode*(...args)* <div class="specs"><i>W3C</i></div> {#previousNode}

Returns the previous <a href="/en-US/docs/Web/API/Node" title="Node is an interface from which various types of DOM API objects inherit, allowing those types to be treated similarly; for example, inheriting the same set of methods, or being testable in the same way."><code>Node</code></a> in the document, or <code>null</code> if there are none.
